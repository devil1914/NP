B. Implement File Transfer Using Pipes (IPC)
Producer Script (writes to the pipe):

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
# Producer script for file transfer
echo "Enter the filename to transfer:"
read filename
cat "$filename" > mypipe
Consumer Script (reads from the pipe):

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
# Consumer script for file transfer
cat < mypipe > output_file
echo "File received and saved as output_file"
Steps to Execute on macOS:

Create a named pipe:
bash
Copy code
mkfifo mypipe
Save the producer script as producer.sh and the consumer script as consumer.sh.
Make them executable:
bash
Copy code
chmod +x producer.sh consumer.sh
In one terminal, run the consumer:
bash
Copy code
./consumer.sh
In another terminal, run the producer:
bash
Copy code
./producer.sh
